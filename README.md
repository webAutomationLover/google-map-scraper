## Prerequisites

**Important:** Google Maps Scraper is only supported on **Firefox browser** and **does not work on Chrome**.

1. **Install Tampermonkey (Firefox only):**

    Google Maps Scraper requires the Tampermonkey extension to run on Firefox. Please install the following version:

    *   **Firefox:** [Tampermonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)

2. **Install the Google Maps Scraper script:**

    You can install the Google Maps Scraper script in two ways:

    **Method 1: Install from Greasy Fork (Recommended)**

    * Click [here](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/537223-google-map-scraper) to install the Google Maps Scraper script. After installation, Tampermonkey will automatically manage the script.

    **Method 2: Install from GitHub**

    * Click [here](https://github.com/webAutomationLover/google-map-scraper/blob/main/google-map-scraper.user.js) to install the Google Maps Scraper script. This link will open the script page on GitHub.
    * On that page, click the "Raw" button.

    * Clicking the "Raw" button will redirect you to the Tampermonkey script installation page. After installation, Tampermonkey will automatically manage the script.

3. **Verify successful installation:**

    To verify that the script has been installed correctly, open the Tampermonkey dashboard. You should see the newly installed script listed there.

    After installation, open [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/search/new+york+car+rental/@40.7319892,-73.9923282,22015m). If you see the **"Export"** and **"Start Auto Scroll"** buttons on the page, Google Maps Scraper has been successfully installed and is running. If you don't see these buttons, check that Tampermonkey is enabled and the script is installed correctly.

5.  **Scroll to load more:** Scroll to the bottom of the page, and the script will automatically load more search results. Repeat this until you have collected enough data.

## Feature: Automatic Scrolling

The script automatically scrolls the page to load more search results, allowing you to collect large amounts of data at once. You don't need to scroll manually; the script does it automatically.

## About Me

I am a developer passionate about web automation. For the past 4 years, I worked at a digital marketing company, developing various productivity tools for the team. 

Compared to Python, command-line tools, etc., I prefer using Tampermonkey to quickly meet the team's needs because it is more intuitive, eliminates the need to install a development environment, and is more user-friendly. 

I hope Google Maps Scraper is helpful to you!
