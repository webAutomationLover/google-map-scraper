# Google Maps Search Result Accumulator & One-Click Export (Non-Chrome Browser Specific)

## Introduction

Hey everyone! I'm a web automation enthusiast. Recently, I decided to develop a script to help a friend with a tedious Google Maps data collection task. My friend needed to repeatedly search for information in specific areas on Google Maps and then manually copy and paste it into an Excel spreadsheet. This process was time-consuming and prone to errors, which was incredibly frustrating!

So, I spent about a week using web automation techniques to write this userscript. It automatically **accumulates** all your search results on Google Maps, no matter if you scroll down to refresh, drag the map to different locations, or perform new searches. It automatically captures the key information and allows you to **export everything in one click** as an Excel (.xlsx) file. Say goodbye to the pain of manual copy-pasting and make data collection easy and efficient!

While helping my friend solve this problem, I discovered that the script was even more practical than I anticipated. So, I decided to share it with everyone in the hope that it can help more people in need.
